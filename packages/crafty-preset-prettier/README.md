## Description

`crafty-preset-prettier` is a preset that is here only to provide IDE integration for your Prettier configuration.
You don't need to install it directly as it comes as a dependency of the presets that need it.

By running `crafty ide` this preset will create a `prettier.config.js` in your working directory.
